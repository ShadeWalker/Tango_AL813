/**
 * Bookkeeping for handling synchronization between pings and other sync related operations.
 * "Ping" refers to a hanging POST or GET that is used to receive push notifications. Ping is
 * the term for the Exchange command, but this code should be generic enough to be extended to IMAP.
 *
 * Basic rules of how these interact (note that all rules are per account):
 * - Only one operation (ping or other active sync operation) may run at a time.
 * - For shorthand, this class uses "sync" to mean "non-ping operation"; most such operations are
 *   sync ops, but some may not be (e.g. EAS Settings).
 * - Syncs can come from many sources concurrently; this class must serialize them.
 *
 * WHEN A SYNC STARTS:
 * - If nothing is running, proceed.
 * - If something is already running: wait until it's done.
 * - If the running thing is a ping task: interrupt it.
 *
 * WHEN A SYNC ENDS:
 * - If there are waiting syncs: signal one to proceed.
 * - If there are no waiting syncs and this account is configured for push: start a ping.
 * - Otherwise: This account is now idle.
 *
 * WHEN A PING TASK ENDS:
 * - A ping task loops until either it's interrupted by a sync (in which case, there will be one or
 *   more waiting syncs when the ping terminates), or encounters an error.
 * - If there are waiting syncs, and we were interrupted: signal one to proceed.
 * - If there are waiting syncs, but the ping terminated with an error: TODO: How to handle?
 * - If there are no waiting syncs and this account is configured for push: This means the ping task
 *   was terminated due to an error. Handle this by sending a sync request through the SyncManager
 *   that doesn't actually do any syncing, and whose only effect is to restart the ping.
 * - Otherwise: This account is now idle.
 *
 * WHEN AN ACCOUNT WANTS TO START OR CHANGE ITS PUSH BEHAVIOR:
 * - If nothing is running, start a new ping task.
 * - If a ping task is currently running, restart it with the new settings.
 * - If a sync is currently running, do nothing.
 *
 * WHEN AN ACCOUNT WANTS TO STOP GETTING PUSH:
 * - If nothing is running, do nothing.
 * - If a ping task is currently running, interrupt it.
